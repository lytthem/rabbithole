    <p>Why are the windows open? Did it ever close? Why and how would it be open? was it always open? Was it just never noticed? </p>

    <p>Things happen in the outsude. Time keeps going on. The cushion deteorates. It sadly does not have enough to protect itself. </p>

    <p> Its hard to see what happened to things that fell. <br>There's limited information there. But all that is clear is that it is just a harsh drop. Once a friend came but bumped onto the window. It fell.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
    <p>I dont know what happened to the friend</p>
    <p style=color:black> I hope the friend is well.</p>
